# About the project
This is my joint final project for the classes Gov1005: Data, and GenEd1150 Medicine & Conflict. Please feel free to view the website [here](/https://elizabeth-pachus.shinyapps.io/gun_project/). I really enjoyed combining the quantitative data science from Gov1005 with the ethical reasoning and thinking from GenEd1150.
