# About the Project

Gun violence in America is one of the most politicized and controversial topics of the twenty first century. The increasing number of mass shootings occurring in public places has drawn increased media attention and kept the gun control debate in the forefront of most Americans minds. However, not many people talk about the hidden epidemic of suicides in the United States, and the vast majority are done with firearms. I wanted to investigate to see if I could find a correlation between the suicide rate in a state and the firearm death rate. Furthermore I wanted to look at veteran mental health and suicides across the states and see if it had any relationship to either of the above variables. I created a model which analyzed the relationship between the suicide rate and year in a given state, and its firearm death rate.

This project involves investigating the American deaths caused by firearms. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the relationship between suicides and firearms in the United States, specifically looking at U.S. Veterans. I also hope to explore the relationship between location and firearm deaths in the country, and have a number of map graphics.

## Conclusions from Statistical Analysis

In conclusion, the statistical analysis was only done on a small subset of the data available and with an equation that was purely inspired by curiosity. Based on the general knowledge that suicide accounts for over 2/3 of firearm deaths in the United States, and that the vast majority of suicides use a firearm, I find it likely that the assumptions from some of the states make sense that an increase in suicide rate would lead to an increase in firearm death rate. This is because suicides by a firearm should be under the umbrella category of firearm deaths. However, it is important to note the limitations of the data, specifically the uncertainty graph. Many models did not fit their states well at all, and therefore are not statistically significant enough to count as reliable data points.

## Some Takeaways from the Project

I had heard talk of the forgotten victims of gun violence in America being suicide victims, but this was the first
time I really familiarized myself with the data. The number of white men who die by suicide in this country is such a stagaringly high number. While mental health is a topic frequently brough up in gun control discussions, I feel as though people do not talk about the incredibly high number of white male suicide the country sees. I hope this exploration of which American are dying by firearms and why will bring the subject into conversation.

While I feel as though I did not discover anything new with this data that researchers had not previously been researched, I personally found it very powerful to take this massive set of data and break it down into more understandable chunks.

Furthermore, I really enjoyed diving into the ethics of this discussion in my Medicine and Conflict narrative, where I enjoyed using Jennifer Terry's piece, "Attachments to War: Biomedical Logics and Violence in Twenty-First-Century America" as well as Marjorie Gehrhardt's piece, "The Men with Broken Faces: Gueules Cassée» of the First World War". when using the compiling the quantitative data found here with the lens of those two authors specifically.  


# The Data

The data in this project comes from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System, which is also run by the CDC. Another portion of my data came from the National Gun Violence Archive. There currently isn't a large public dataset related to gun violence in America, and this project involved creating the first public database of its kind on the internet. An interesting effect of how politicized gun violence in America is would be the lack of a public dataset related to firearm injuries in the United States. The data included in my project includes the deaths caused by firearms in the United States between the years of 2001 and 2017. Some variables included in the data set would be: death rate per 1,000 people by state, number of people killed each year by firearms, was there a violent intent in the death or was it an accident.

The C.D.C and V.A. have worked together to compile an assortment of neat data on suicides in American and veteran suicides specifically. I was intrigued to find a much greater ease in compiling the data for firearms and suicides than I did for violent crimes involving firearms. 

I was happy to find a dataset complied by FiveThirtyEight for their project on [Gun Death's in America](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/) and their breakdown of the data serves as some of the inspiration for this project.
